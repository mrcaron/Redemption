My Story
========

The Setup
---------
My story starts about the time my mom and dad split up, I was about six. Emotionally I was a pretty wrecked kid who grew up into an emotionally wrecked young adult. I didn't have any sense of self-value or self-worth, the divorce sorta stole that from me. I comforted mom instead of being comforted by mom, this is all my six-year-old memory mind you. I listened to her hurts and pains and didn't talk about mine so that she'd be safe. Dad was a different story, I just felt like I never measured up, that he never really wanted to spend time with me; I was inconvenient. He was away, only saw him every other weekend if he didn't cancel. I had a built-in sense of insignificance and saw myself as valueless.

Growing up, I had a few friends, like the kids on the block that I rode BMX bikes with, even had a girl friend at one time (God's grace to me). But my general experience was that of aversion, ridicule and harrassment. I tried to find worth and value everywhere because I didn't have any sense of it myself. Trying to appear valuable by getting awesome grades only invited kids to use me and cheat off me (for which I almost got expelled!); trying to wear the cool clothes only made me a poser. I sat at a lunch table with kids that made fun of me the whole time because I didn't want to sit alone, even the school counselor thought that I was nuts and offered his services. I smothered the gf after a month, I was so needy. I couldn't stand up for myself, literally had no dignity. I just withdrew further and further into myself, became that loner guy who tried to read cool looking lit books to appear sophisticated so I could think of myself as better than everyone else. I increasingly smoked pot because numbed me to people not caring about me, whatever. It was a perfect set up for the emotional and sexual abuse I experienced at the hand of an older man when I was 18, I mean, I didn't think I was really worth anything. I was a mess.

Hound of Heaven
---------------

But God was pursuing me that whole time. Have you ever had that feeling that you know something, but you don't know it exactly? Like, when you close your eyes and there's someone standing in front of you; you know it, but you don't _know it_. It's a sort of experiential reality that you can't explain. God was like that to me. I _just knew_ deep down that God was real and that He was someone to know.

I was exposed to a lot of church stuff growing up; school, extra meetings, summers at a Christian music festival some of you remember Cornerstone, youth rallys. In all those years, God planted little bits of understanding in me like so many puzzle pieces that I didn't know how to put together entirely; rudimentry knowledge of Jesus like he was the Son of God and died on a cross to forgive my sins, that he rose from the dead. Knowledge about Jesus, but not how he felt about me. It didn't hit those heart strings aching for value and acceptance.

Along the way, someone told me something else about Jesus; that He wanted me to surrender my whole life to him, not just tell him what I was doing bad and have him clean up the mess; he wasn't a get out of jail free card I could use to live my life any way I wanted to. And bing, there was that deep feeling again... like God was addressing me face to face. Give me a clean slate? Sign me up! Surrender my life...? Not so much. You mean, stop smoking pot? Ask God what I should do about daily life? Maybe He wants me to give up all my posessions to the poor and live as a bum! Can't do that. I understood that forgiveness was only the other side of the surrender coin and the two were inseperable.

Encounter
---------

It's three weeks before I'm set to start at UIUC, and I'm celebrating at the wedding of some friends, Tom & Charity Osborne. I had abandoned my buddy's car dead and unstartable on I-88 somewhere around DeKalb and hitchhiked the rest of the way. I had no extra clothes, no cell phone (it was 1995, man!), very little money. Tom & Charity were Christians I had met a few years prior. A handful of their friends drove out to the car with me and tried to start it after the party was over. As we watched the sun dawn, we figured we'd try the next day. A young church friend of theirs let me stay with him. Next morning, he lent me some of his clothes, fed me breakfast. Tom's church gave me $200 to get the car out of impound, freely. I spent the next three days there due to the car in the company of these kind, generous and loving folks.

That weekend, the generosity of these people who hardly knew me, their conversation with each other about daily life revealed a God who is personal and cares, not off in some lofty distant cloud disappointed in me. The way they prayed was entirely different, it was filled with hope and passion, like it really mattered. Their faith was authentic, not bolted-on. I wanted to be like them, I wanted what they had, I loved what I had been experiencing and wanted more. That weekend, God put all those puzzle pieces together, I _experienced_ how Jesus felt about me, He accepted me, He valued me. And the wall keeping me from surrendering, from giving Jesus full access to me was broken. I engaged a friendship with Jesus that He started and hasn't stopped.

Unfolding Transformation
------------------------

What I _knew_ and then _experienced_ has been unfolding since that day. Immediately, I stopped smoking (everything). I found a bible in our house and started reading it. I was woken up by God early in the morning when I used to sleep until noon. I just started talking to God. I drove the six hour road trip to Sterling each week before coming to UIUC to be with those folks and worship Jesus who "saved me".

I came to UIUC excited. I really don't think I've ever stopped being excited... but that first Quad Day. Whoa. I met Wager and there entered a guy who's been a dicipler, friend, shoulder to cry on, spiritual father. Wage and Janel shaped my early life, guys. I remember trying to pray off in the gardens next to FAR.

I remember talking to God on the way back to FAR; "God, oh I HOPE that is the church where you want me to be! Those guys seem awesome!" I asked God for a sign and that night at the ilife rally, I won a door prize. BOOM, I was in. I jumped in a small group, lighting setup, the whole works. I did so much I went on probation my first semester! 

Jesus is alive in me, and he was changing everything; my motivations for living, the kind of life I wanted, the words coming out of my mouth... everything was being reworked. There is story after story of his hand in my life. 

I've been to Minneapolis and Berlin as a missionary church planter. I'm in Madison as a father, physical and spiritual...

The Call
--------

Why embark on a friendship with Jesus? He'll hold your hand and show you the real you, redeem your history and give you a future. He'll show you that you were intentionally made and he'll unfold His glory in your life. You can trade your ashes for His beauty and enjoy him the moment you begin and it only gets better and better.
