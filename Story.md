My Story
========

The Setup
---------
My story starts about the time my mom and dad split up, I was about six. Emotionally I was a pretty wrecked kid who grew up into an emotionally wrecked young adult. I didn't have any sense of self-value or self-worth, the divorce sorta stole that from me. I comforted mom instead of being comforted by mom, this is all my six-year-old memory mind you. I listened to her hurts and pains and didn't talk about mine so that she'd be safe. Dad was a different story, I just felt like I never measured up, that he never really wanted to spend time with me; I was inconvenient. He was away, only saw him every other weekend if he didn't cancel.

Growing up, I had a few friends, like the kids on the block that I rode BMX bikes with, even had a girl friend at one time (God's grace to me). But my general experience was that of aversion, ridicule and harrassment. I tried to find worth and value everywhere because I didn't have any sense of it myself. Trying to appear valuable by getting awesome grades only invited kids to use me and cheat off me (for which I almost got expelled!); trying to wear the cool clothes only made me a poser. I sat at a lunch table with kids that made fun of me the whole time because I didn't want to sit alone, even the school counselor thought that I was nuts and offered his services. I smothered the gf after a month, I was so needy. I couldn't stand up for myself, literally had no dignity. I just withdrew further and further into myself, became that loner guy who tried to read cool looking lit books to appear sophisticated so I could think of myself as better than everyone else. I increasingly smoked pot because numbed me to people not caring about me, whatever. It was a perfect set up for the emotional and sexual abuse I experienced at the hand of an older man when I was 18, I mean, I didn't think I was really worth anything. I was a mess.

But God was pursuing me.

Hound of Heaven

I was exposed to a lot of church stuff through my mom. After the divorce, we moved. New church, new school, new neighborhood. I was in Catholic school, uniforms, the whole bit. We went to these extra church meetings, even at other churches, where I saw people who seemed to really like God. These people sang songs with passion and had tears in their eyes when they prayed because they were passionate. There was something stable about those meetings that attracted me, and I had nothing better to do.

In high school, our family counselor got us going to this summer Christian music festival called Cornerstone. It was put on by The Jesus People USA. Really? I had imagined rolling hills dotted with gazeebos and white clothes dressed accoustic guitar players bathed in warm sunshine. Instead, my suburban eyes gawked at 2 foot mohawks on the heads of punk rockers ornamented with spikey leathery choakers and the ilk. This was going to be fun. My whole church world thing was blown away, this was cool. I dove in, bought tons of music, a metal cross made out of nails. One year, I even applied to go overseas with these guys, Teen Mania, telling people about Jesus through drama. I just thought it would be cool to travel. We switched churches after our first time there and I learned more about Jesus there than all my years in Catholic school.

It's three weeks before I'm set to start at UIUC, and I'm now stranded three hours from home in Sterling, IL where I had come to see Tom & Charity Osborne get married. having abandoned a stalled friend's car on I-88 enroute to Tom & Charity Osborne's wedding

I met some folks at that festival that changed my life. Some of you know Tom & Charity Osborne. I was walking by their van and saw a campfire. Through events that I can't remember, I ended up hanging out at that camp fire, listening, watching. I hung out at that camp fire year after year; they were so friendly and they didn't mind me.
