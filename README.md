Redemption
==========

The story of how I met Jesus and how He redeemed my life

Motivation
----------
In an effort to better articulate what happened when Jesus entered my life, I wanted to write down the story in a format concise enough to share with friends within five minutes and detailed enough to give glory to Jesus for what He's done and continues to do in, through and to me.

Summary
-------
1. Pre-Jesus - Desparation of depression, I'm noone special
2. Meet-Jesus - Arise, Mike! I LOVE YOU! Let me take over.
3. Post-Jesus - I'm showing you who I made you to be, giving you a new vision
   for your life with significance
